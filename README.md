# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection App

This is a Streamlit web app that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer using machine learning models trained on medical data (such as the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset).

The goal is to provide an easy-to-use interface where users can input medical measurements and get a prediction about whether the tumor is benign or malignant.



## ✨ Features

- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- Input form for user medical data (e.g., mean radius, mean texture, etc.)
- Prediction using Scikit-Learn machine learning models
- Real-time results displayed with clear labels
- Easy deployment on Streamlit Cloud
